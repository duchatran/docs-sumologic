This topic describes how to install and configure Sumo Logic Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

Before you install the Sumo Logic Nozzle for PCF tile, you need to have a [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/pricing/) account.

##<a id='create'></a>Create a UAA User for the Nozzle
 
Follow the steps below to create a UAA user that gives the nozzle access to the [Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) and [Cloud Controller](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html).

1. Install the UAA Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, `uaac`:

    <pre class="terminal">$ gem install cf-uaac</pre>

1. Target your UAA server by running the `uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` command. See the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ uaac target uaa.sys.example.com</pre>

1. Record `uaa:admin:client_secret` from one of the following:
<br><br>
    * The Cloud Foundry deployment manifest
    * The Ops Manager Installation Dashboard

    To retrieve `client_secret` from Ops Manager, click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime**, navigate to the **Credentials** tab, and locate the **Admin Client Credentials** entry in the **UAA** section.

1. Authenticate to UAA using `client_secret` obtained in the previous step:
    <pre class="terminal">$  uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET</pre>

For more information about creating a UAA user, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html).
