     3. (Optional) **Sumo Logic Name**: Specify a source name locally to distinguish it from the configured HTTP Source configuration and prevent metadata overwrites if you have more than one use for that source. For example, MyPivotalApp.

     8. **Skip SSL Validation**: This option should only be checked if you are on a known and trusted dev enviroment and have expired certificates. Do not enable this option for a production system.
     9. **Verbose in 'LogMessage' event**: Enable this option if you need more detail than the default logging information, 'timestamp', 'cf_app_guid', 'Msg'. This is what a log message looks like when you
