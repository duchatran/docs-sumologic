## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Sumo Logic is a secure, AWS-hosted machine data analytics service delivering real-time insights from logs, metrics, and event data across the entire app lifecycle and stack.
The Sumo Logic service centralizes and unifies log data and time-series metrics and leverages machine learning analysis to uncover real-time insights into app operations and security.

The Sumo Logic service provides the following:

* Granular visibility across your entire app stack, including apps, infrastructure, and services (cloud or hybrid)
* Proactive problem identification and troubleshooting with machine learning-driven analytics. Sumo Logic leverages pattern identification, outlier detection, and predictive trending to quickly alert and troubleshoot app and infrastructure performance and security issues.
* Pre-built analytics and dashboard support for AWS, Azure, hybrid and on-prem app, infrastructure, and services. For example, Sumo Logic supports several AWS services, including Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon VPC Flow Logs, AWS Config, and AWS Lambda out-of-the-box.
* Instant value with a highly scalable and secure SaaS service. Your data is protected in the Sumo Logic platform, which has industry security certifications, including PCI DSS 3.2 Service Provider Level 1 and HIPAA.
* Elastic scalability. The multi-tenant architecture scales on demand to support rapid app growth and cloud migration. The service overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional architectures by allowing organizations to burst as needed without manual intervention.
